# Double Ads

### If a PM says that they want to double the number of ads in Newsfeed, how would you figure out if this is a good idea or not?

Clarifying Questions:

1\) What is the purpose of doubling the number of ads?

2\) Why do I want to **double** the number?

* Impact of doubling the newsfeed
  * Care about the long-term value 
    * Company: Increase revenue and profit 
    * User: Decrease the user experience of utilizing the product 
      * For example, decreases their views of the posts
* Success Metrics 
  * AD: Click through Rate \(CTR\)
  * Engagement
    * DAU / WAU / MAU 
    * User Session Time 
* A/ B Testing 
  * Hypothesis: 
    * H0: The CTR before is no more than the one after doubling the ads. 
    * H0: The DAU/WAU/MAU before is no more than the one after doubling the ads. 
    * H0: The Session\_Time before is no more than the one after doubling the ads. 
  * Experiment Set-up 
    * Unit of diversion: Users
      * How long?    
        * Short-term experiment 
          * Volume of population 
          * Sample size -- power 
        * Long-term effect monitoring 
        * Randomization 
          * Different factors for consideration:  Time, area, device XXX 
            * Time: Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Evening - confounding factors ??
          * Control group and Experiment Group 
  * Sample Size 
    * Power analysis: significant _level \(alpha\), effect\_ size, Beta \(TypeII\) \(Check\)_
  * _Metrics_ conflict 
  * Calibration of two metrics 
    * Revenue ---- DAU decrease \(revenue loss\)
    * CTR ---revenue increase 
  * Company mission
