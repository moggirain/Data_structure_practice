## How would you find the cause of a 15% drop in Facebook Groups usage?

* **Clarifying questions:** 
  * **Metric:** What do you mean by groups usage, and how do you measure it? 
    * Engagement?
    * Group creation?
  * If engagement: how to measure?
    * Avg time people spent on group
    * Avg number of posts
    * Avg reaction to the posts?
  * If the total count for all activities, as called the total engagement
* **What is the business goal?** 
* **What is the success metric?** 
* **High level framework:**
  * **The cause might be resulted from** 
    * **Internal:** user behaviour, as evidenced \# by posts, replies, share drop 
    * **External-Product / Competitor effect** users shift to other features or other products 
  * To diagnose which one is the cause, I will start by asking the questions to check if we really need to care about the effect.  
    * **Context: Should we care about the drop?** 
      * One-time drop or consistent drop?
        * If one-time event 
          * Technical glitches 
          * system down service 
        * If consistent
          * Dive into it 
      * Is this drop happens only for this week or month, or seasonally? Holiday issue? Seasonality issue?
        * Seasonally
          * Holiday season issue
          * Post-Promotion or special event 
* Is this drop regional or cross all area?
* * **Context**
  * Internal
    * System
    * User behaviour
