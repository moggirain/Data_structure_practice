# FB Case Study

### **Case 1:**  If 70% of Facebook users on iOS use Instagram, but only 35% of Facebook users on Android use Instagram, how would you investigate the discrepancy? 



### **Case 2:**  If a PM says that they want to double the number of ads in Newsfeed, how would you figure out if this is a good idea or not?



### Case 3: **How many high schools that people have listed on their profiles are real? How do we find out, and deploy at scale, a way of finding invalid schools?**
