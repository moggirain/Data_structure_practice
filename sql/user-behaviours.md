# User behaviours

### Interactions

#### Q1. Find proportion of people who communicating to 5+ people each day? 

```sql
Table: interaction
|date | timestamp | sender | receiver
# output: user_who_communicate5+ / all_user
# step1: date | user | message_count 
# step2: filter >= 5 
# step2: calculate proportion 
WITH t1 AS (
SELECT date, 
       sender as user
FROM  interaction 
UNION ALL 
SELECT date, 
       receiver as user 
FROM interaction ), 
t2 AS (SELECT date, 
       user, 
       COUNT(*) as message_cnt
FROM t1
GROUP BY 1, 2) 

SELECT date, 
       SUM(IF message_cnt >=5, 1, 0) / COUNT(user) as proportion
FROM t2 
GROUP BY 1  
```

#### **Q2. \*\*Find fraction of people who respond within 60s**

```sql
Table: interaction
|date | timestamp | sender | receiver
# clarifying questions:
# all messages are responded within 60sï¼Ÿ
# or average respond time within 60s?
# or at least one message responsed within 60s?
# if at least one message
# output: distinct_user_responded_all_within60s / all user
# step1: find user pairs and self join table 
# step2: filter those timestamp diff within 60second 
# step3: count distinct 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT t2.receiver) / 
       COUNT(SELECT DISTINCT t2.receiver FROM interaction) as fraction
FROM interaction t1, interaction t2 
WHERE t1.sender = t2.receiver AND t1.receiver = t2.sender
AND timestampdiff('second', timestamp(t2.date, t2.time), timestamp(t1.date, t1.time))<= 60
AND timestampdiff('second', timestamp(t2.date, t2.time), timestamp(t2.date, b.time)) >= 0
```
