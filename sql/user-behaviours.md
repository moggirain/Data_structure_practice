# User behaviours

### Interactions

#### Q1. Find proportion of people who communicating to 5+ people each day? 

```sql
Table: interaction
|date | timestamp | sender | receiver
# output: user_who_communicate5+ / all_user
# step1: date | user | message_count 
# step2: filter >= 5 
# step2: calculate proportion 
WITH t1 AS (
SELECT date, 
       sender as user
FROM  interaction 
UNION ALL 
SELECT date, 
       receiver as user 
FROM interaction ), 
t2 AS (SELECT date, 
       user, 
       COUNT(*) as message_cnt
FROM t1
GROUP BY 1, 2) 

SELECT date, 
       SUM(IF message_cnt >=5, 1, 0) / COUNT(user) as proportion
FROM t2 
GROUP BY 1  
```

#### **Q2. Find fraction of people who respond within 60s**

```sql
Table: interaction
|date | timestamp | sender | receiver
# clarifying questions:
# all messages are responded within 60sï¼Ÿ
# or average respond time within 60s?
# or at least one message responsed within 60s?
# if all messages are responded within 60s 
# output: distinct_user_responded_all_within60s / all user
# step1: find user pairs and self join table 
# step2: filter those timestamp diff within 60second 
# step3: count distinct 

SELECT date, 
       timestamp, 
       sender, 
       receiver 
FROM 
```
