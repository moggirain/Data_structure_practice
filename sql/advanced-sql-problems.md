**Q1:  MoM Percent Change**

Oftentimes it's useful to know how much a key metric, such as monthly active users, changes between months. ****Find the month-over-month percentage change for monthly active users \(MAU\).  


**Q2:  Retained Users Per Month \(multi-part\)** 

Write a query that gets the number of retained users per month. In this case, retention for a given month is defined as the number of users who logged in that month who also logged in the immediately previous month.  
  


**Q3. Customer Churn** 

Now weâ€™ll take retention and turn it on its head: Write a query to find many users last month did not come back this month. i.e. the number of churned users.
