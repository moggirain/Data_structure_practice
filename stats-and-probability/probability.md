# Probability

**Q1. \(Facebook-Easy\) There is a fair coin \(one side heads, one side tails\) and an unfair coin \(both sides tails\). You pick one at random, flip it 5 times, and observe that it comes up as tails all five times. What is the chance that you are flipping the unfair coin?**

$$
P(U|5T) = \frac{P(5T|U) * P(U)}{P(5T|U) * P(U) + P(5T|F) * P(F)} = \frac{0.5}{0.5 + 0.5 * 1/32} = 0.97
$$

**Q2. \[Lyft - Easy\] You and your friend are playing a game. The two of you will continue to toss a coin until the sequence HH or TH shows up. If HH shows up first, you win. If TH shows up first, your friend wins. What is the probability of you winning?**

**\[Facebook - Easy\]** Facebook has a content team that labels pieces of content on the platform as spam or not spam. 90% of them are diligent raters and will label 20% of the content as spam and 80% as non-spam. The remaining 10% are non-diligent raters and will label 0% of the content as spam and 100% as non-spam. Assume the pieces of content are labeled independently from one another, for every rater. Given that a rater has labeled 4 pieces of content as good, what is the probability that they are a diligent rater?

**\[Facebook - Easy\]** There are 50 cards of 5 different colors. Each color has cards numbered between 1 to 10. You pick 2 cards at random. What is the probability that they are not of same color and also not of same number?

**\[Facebook - Easy\]** What is the expected number of rolls needed to see all 6 sides of a fair die?
